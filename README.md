# Aerial-Robotics-Course-UPenn
This project, part of the Aerial Robotics course, focuses on implementing smooth trajectory generation and PD control for a quadrotor in a 3D environment. The goal is to create continuous motion through waypoints while maintaining stability and accuracy using PD control.
